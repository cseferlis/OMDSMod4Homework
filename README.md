# BU OMDS MOD 4: Data Management at Scale

### Course and Homework Overview
This course empowers students with the skills to design and implement data processing workflows essential for informed decision-making organizations and otherwise. Throughout the semester, students will navigate the full data science lifecycle—from question formulation to data collection, wrangling, analysis, and visualization. The course applies tools and techniques for data collection, integration, and interpretation across relational (SQL), non-relational (NoSQL), and Big Data paradigms, enabling students to build, optimize, and maintain data pipelines and decision-making algorithms. When you have finished this course and related assignments, you too can join the illustrious group of BU Data Warriors!

### Core Topics Covered
- Consolidation, synchronization, and summarization of multiple data streams
- Data maintenance and availability
- Optimization and analytics for large-scale, static, and streaming data
- Interactive visualization platforms for online and offline data presentation
- Real-world data applications in equity, sustainability, health, and civic technology through collaborations with CDS Impact Labs and co-Labs

### Course Objectives
Upon completion, students will gain hands-on experience and expertise in:
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Design and implementation for efficient data flows
- **Complex Data Modeling**: Architecting for various data requirements
- **Distributed Workloads**: System support for processing large data volumes
- **Relational Query Optimization**: Improving SQL query performance
- **Data Stream Processing**: Understanding dataflow programming and stream processing
- **Modern Data Processing Systems**: Exposure to Hadoop, Apache Spark, Databricks, and similar systems
- **Collaborative Projects**: Practical exposure to project management tools and software engineering best practices

## Getting Started with Assignments

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a Microsoft Azure student account. Instructions for setup of environment resources to be used for individual assignments will be provided in each homework assignment page.

#### The following instructions are for setting up your Azure environment homework resources starting with "Homework 1b", to ensure proper service deployment and minimum expenditure. Similar to many organizations, each Azure service option has an SKU assigned with availability dictated by capacity and resources within each Azure region. For each asssignment where resources do not have manual instructions for deployment, you will use the following instructions and specify each homework assignment in the details of the deployment. If you run into trouble, please work with your Learning Facilitator for assistance. These instructions assume you have created your Azure account, and deployed the necessary resources in Homework 1a as you move on to subsequent assignments. If not, please head over there first before continuing.

> For this course, you will use the “Azure for Students” offer provided by Microsoft. This offer allows for a $100 credit that can be replenished once a year as long as a student email address is being used. You will be expected to manage your budget. By adhering closely to the instructions outlined in the homework assignments, you will remain within the $100 credit limit. However, any expenses incurred beyond this allocation will be your responsibility.  

1. **Sign In**: Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your student account.
   
3. **Access Cloud Shell**: 
   - Use the **[>_]** button next to the search bar to open a new Cloud Shell.
   - Select **PowerShell** as the environment, creating storage if prompted. Choose the "Azure for Students" subscription.
   - You can resize the Cloud Shell pane or minimize it using the controls on the top right.

    > **Note**: You may use **Bash** or **PowerShell** by changing the environment in the Cloud Shell pane's dropdown.

4. **Clone the Repository**:
   - In the PowerShell pane, enter the following command to clone the course repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cseferlis/OMDSMod4Homework.git
   ```
   
5. **Navigate to the Homework Directory**:
   - After cloning, switch to the main folder for the exercises:
   ```bash
   cd OMDSMod4Homework

   cd  '<Homework Folder>'

   cd '<Homework Name Folder>'
   ```
   - Tip: If you’re unsure what folders are available, use the ```ls``` command to list the contents of the current directory.

6. **Running Setup Scripts**:
   - Navigate to the specific `homework` directory you’re working on and run the setup script to generate necessary files:
   ```bash
   bash ./formTemplate.sh
   ```

7. **Deploying Resources in Azure**:

- This command will use a predefined template to create resources as required for the assignment.

	- Use the following command, replacing placeholders marked with <resource-group-name>, <path-to-template.json>, and <path-to-parameters.json> using the actual resource group name, template, and parameter file paths for your environment:
      
	```bash
	az deployment group create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --template-file <path-to-template.json> --parameters <path-to-parameters.json>
	```
      
	- For Example:
      
	```bash
	az deployment group create --resource-group cbsomdsrg --template-file ./template/template.json --parameters ./template/parameters.json
	```
      
	> Note: Your Resource Group should be the name of the one entered from the one you create in Homework 1a. This will ensure you always deploy resources to the same region as what is specified with the Resource Group. This is handled within the template.json file.

   - Troubleshooting:
	   -	If you encounter an error stating that you are in the wrong subscription, you need to check and switch to the correct one. (This includes the error message: "The content for this response was already consumed")
	   -	Run the following commands in PowerShell to list your available subscriptions:
      ```bash
      az account list
      ```
      	- Look for the Azure for Students subscription ID.
      	- Once you have the correct subscription ID, set it using:
      ```bash
      az account set --subscription "<Your Subscription ID>"
      ```
     	- Or set it using:
      ```bash
      az account set --subscription "Azure for Students"
      ```
      	- Then, retry the deployment command.
